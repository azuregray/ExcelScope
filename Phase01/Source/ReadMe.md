Instructions to run "main.py":
    1. First Install the latest python (using provisional package from python.org or any cli tools)
    2. Then use pip to install the requirements.
    3. Requirements are stored in a file that can be read by pip
    4. So having current directory as `WorkTools-Data-Search-Model/Phase01/Source/` : run the file as is :: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    5. Now the main Py executable has to run without errors.
